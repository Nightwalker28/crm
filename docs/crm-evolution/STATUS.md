# CRM evolution — where the waves stand

The handover for `CODEX-RUNBOOK.md`: a new session reads this instead of reconstructing
progress from the code. Update it at the end of every wave run, including partial ones.

Last updated 2026-09-29.

| Wave | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 0A–0D | Done | Lead journey baseline, `QuickCreateSurface`, `record_layouts.py` resolver, generated contracts in `frontend/contracts/` |
| 1A–1B | Done | `LeadQuickCreate`, `RecordLayoutPreview` |
| 1C–1F | Done | `RecordWorkspace`, `record_activity.py`, `mail_associations.py`, `RecordEmailComposer` |
| 2A | Done | Contact and Organization Quick Create, contextual Account → Contact / Deal |
| 2B–2C | Done | `sales_opportunity_contacts`, `opportunity_participants_routes.py` |
| **2D** | **Done — see below** | Opportunity Quick Create (rebuild 5.4 A3); participant display and management |
| 2E | Not started | No pipeline/stage models, no Kanban |
| 3A onward | Not started | |

## Wave 2D — participant management (2026-09-29)

Frontend Phase 2 of `05-relationships-data-model.md`, on the Phase 2 APIs that were already
in place. Phase 1 (display) and Opportunity Quick Create had landed earlier.

- `components/opportunities/OpportunityParticipants.tsx` — the `Participants` panel on the
  deal's `Related records` tab: add (contact picker, role, primary), change role, make
  primary, remove with a confirmation and an Undo that calls the restore route. A contact
  not yet in the CRM is created in place through Contact Quick Create with the deal's
  account filled in, and the add panel reopens with that contact selected.
- Placement follows design.md §4.7: a participant is a row pointing at the deal, so it is
  managed in the content region, not the spine. The spine's `Participants` count is now
  drawn at zero too, because the tab it opens is where people are added.
- Permissions mirror the routes: add, change role and make primary need deal `edit`;
  removal needs `delete`; Undo needs `restore`. The whole panel needs Contacts `view`
  (`can_view_contacts`). The server enforces all of it independently.
- No backend change, no migration, no contract change.

Verification: lint and build are clean; `check-design.sh` passes 21 of 21;
`opportunity-participants.spec.ts` passes 5 of 5; the panel was checked in both themes
(body `rgb(11, 13, 16)` / `rgb(247, 248, 250)`). `opportunities-revamp.spec.ts` fails 3 of 3
at the default 30s both with and without this change (a stashed-HEAD baseline). At 90s it
fails only `pipeline totals … retry` on the list page, which this change does not touch.

Left open: see *Deferred* below.

**Next:** Wave 2E — the pipeline compatibility phase of `04-pipelines-kanban.md`, starting
with the inventory of every stage comparison.

## Deferred — not built, and when to build it

Each row is deliberately unbuilt. The trigger column says when it is due. Check this table at
the start of every wave, and build a row in the wave its trigger names, not earlier.

| Item | Why it waits | Build it when |
|---|---|---|
| Contextual email recipient selection from deal participants (05 frontend Phase 3) | Needs the Opportunity email rollout to consume it | **Wave 3A, Opportunity run** — explicit candidates, deliberate selection when more than one |
| Broader relationship rail on Contact/Account: related deals, quotes, orders, tasks, documents with permission-aware counts (05 frontend Phase 4) | Depends on relationship summaries (05 backend Phase 4), which is unbuilt | After 2E, as its own slice, backend Phase 4 first |
| Participants propagated through Lead conversion and Quote/Order creation (05 backend Phase 3) | A downstream behaviour change; out of 2D's scope | Its own slice after 2E, before 3A's Opportunity run |
| A view of removed participants (`/participants/recycle` has no UI) | Undo covers the immediate case | When an operator needs to restore a participant after the Undo toast is gone, or with a shared record-level recycle view |
| Catalog ↔ quote/order line items (`catalog_product_id` / `catalog_service_id`) | Filed by rebuild 5.3 as its own slice | A standalone slice; not tied to a wave |
| Custom-module EAV filtering over `custom_module_record_values` (rebuild Appendix B.2) | A backend query-parameter contract | A standalone slice; the toolbar already stopped claiming the filter works |
| `RequiredMark` not announced to screen readers (about 54 of 68 uses) | A primitive decision for the owner: a `Field` context, or the mark taking its control's id | When the owner picks the approach; then fix in the primitive, not at each call site |
| `opportunities-revamp.spec.ts` "pipeline totals … retry" fails (inherited, reproduces at HEAD) | Not caused by 2D; unread beyond attribution | At the start of 2E, which reworks the pipeline surface anyway |
